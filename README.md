#Application: DoodleLife

Purpose: Allow users to draw on pictures

#MVP stories:

User can register for DoodleLife
User can login to DoodleLife
User can draw in an HTML canvas environment
User can add cat pics to HTML canvas and draw on them (aka... turn them into dogs, bc dogs are better than cats)
User can see different cats for each log in (or each page refresh)
Users sees some scalability of site

#Current Issues: 
1. mouseX and mouseY offset incorrect, currently researching redraw() as a possible solution
2. margin, position and sizing issues with color buttons. 


#Next release (way cooler than cats):
User can log in via instagram Oauth
User can select from own instagram photos and draw on them

#Stretch:
User can capture their drawings and save them (either to db or instagram)
User sees a fully scalable site with clean CSS styling

#Key learning:
HTML5 Canvas 
The Cat API
(coming soon) Instagram Oauth

Application: DoodleLife

Purpose: Allow users to draw on pictures

MVP stories:

User can register for DoodleLife
User can login to DoodleLife
User can draw in an HTML canvas environment
User can add cat pics to HTML canvas and draw on them (aka... turn them into dogs, bc dogs are better than cats)
User can see different cats for each log in (or each page refresh)

Current Issues: 
1. mouseX and mouseY offset incorrect
2. 


Next release (way cooler than cats):
User can log in via instagram Oauth
User can select from own instagram photos and draw on them

Stretch:
User can capture their drawings and save them (either to db or instagram)
